## Purpose
The goals of this repo are:
1. Allow others to replicate our lightsheet manuscript
2. Allow non-Brody users to use and take advantage of these tools
3. Allow Brody lab members easy access to the tools developed and implemented on Priniceton's HPC spock

## To use
1. Generate the lightsheet environment
2. Activate the ClearMap2 git module

## Acknowledgements
